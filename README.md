## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

One major learning from this project was how to effectively use CSS Grid to create responsive layouts. Below is an example snippet:

```css
.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
  gap: 20px;
}
```

### Continued development

I plan to continue focusing on improving my JavaScript skills, particularly in the area of asynchronous programming.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Tricks: A Complete Guide to Grid](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) - This guide was invaluable for understanding CSS Grid.
